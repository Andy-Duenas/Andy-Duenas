## :man_technologist:	About Me
Growing up, I was very curious how things worked. If there was a topic where I wanted to learn more, I would spend hours doing research on my own. When I was first introduced to programming, I couldn't fathom the amount of possibilities one can do. I was doing my research on the different languages and technologies until Web development caught my eye. My passion for Web developement came from the ability to create what I can imagine and the endless possibilities of creating web applications to help improve everyday life.
